This check is an execution of a computational workflow created in the context of a ReScience article (<https://rescience.github.io/bibliography/hathway_2018.html>, <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1327348>).
It adds another layer of confirmation to the applaudable efforts of a reference impleementation for the original research article (<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001377>).
The GitHub repo <https://github.com/codecheckers/Hathway-Goodman-2018> was forked from the original repository a while back and the check has been taken up by a new codechecker now.
`r gitInfo`

The repository contains a short README following the ReScience template.
Code was written in Python.
I went through the following steps based on the extensive instructions in `code/README.md` based on the section **"Quick running of the code"**.

```bash
conda update conda

cd code
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

```
LibMambaUnsatisfiableError: Encountered problems while solving:
  - nothing provides bsddb needed by brian2-2.1.2-np113py27h568d706_0
```

I'm now trying brian2 without version `2.2.1` because it is pretty close and available at https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/brian2/labels.
However, the channel `brian-team` does not exist anymore: <https://conda.anaconda.org/brian-team> linked from <https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.1/introduction/install.html> gives a error message "page does not exist".
Therefore, I removed all pinned versions except for Python and the main library, which could finally be resolved by conda:

```yml
dependencies:
  - brian2=2.*
  - matplotlib
  - numba
  - numpy
  - python=3.6.5
```

```bash
conda activate HathwayGoodman
```

As suggested in the README, I ran the following command to generate most figures but reusing some data:

```bash
python main.py
```

The code completed without any errors but included a few (deprecation) warnings and library errors, the log output was as below:

This finished in a few minutes.
The command also opened 11 windows with figures, see screenshot:

![Screenshot of windows for figures 1 to 11](screenshot-figure-1-to-11.png)

From a visual inspection, the figures seem to match the ones from the ReScience reproduction paper, some of which having small visualisation details (missing x at data points, dot sizes of data points, missing annotations), some of which having slightly different graph curves in details (spikes etc.), but all of which match overall setup (scale, axes labels).

As the readme notes, the figures are also saved in `article/figures/` and are included in the check materials and embedded below.

Because it was the end of my workday, I run the next command with "less repetitions" and see if it actually completes within 8-24 hours on my laptop:

```bash
python main.py --new True
```

At the next morning, the code completed with similar warnigns and errors as above, but also with a lot of log statements on the computations - see file `log-new-true.txt`.
From what I cen tell from the file dates and file names, files for the figures 5, 6, 7CD, and 8 were newly created, all included in the check material and embedded below.

- `codecheck/figure_5_created_250520.pdf`
- `codecheck/figure_6_created_250520.pdf`
- `codecheck/figure_7CD_seed28_created_250520.pdf`
- `codecheck/figure_8_created_250520.pdf`

Figure 5 shows an additinal data line in each subfigure compared to "Figure 5 saved results" in the newly created version, which makes sense because the README points out a different parametrisation.

Figure 6 seems to have a smaller error bar (?) compared to "Figure 6 saved results" but largely matches the figure created first.

Figure 7CD and 8 match precisely.

The documentation in the README on the details seems extensive and helpful for further investigations.
However, with respect to this CODECHECK, I stop at this point of a successful reproduction of all figures in the article.
It is noteworthy to point out that this community check was conduceted several years after the original workflow was created.
The successful reproduction is a testament to the efforts of the authors as well as the contributors to the libraries and software infrastructure.

## Recommendations

I suggest to the authors to consider the following suggestions for their next publication or workflow:

- Add a license (or several because of the data) to the repository to make it legally (re)usable

# About CODECHECK

This certificate confirms that the codechecker could independently
reproduce the results of a computational analysis given the data and
code from a third party.  A CODECHECK does not check whether the
original computation analysis is correct.  However, as all materials
required for the reproduction are freely available by following the
links in this document, the reader can then study for themselves the
code and data.
